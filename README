CRAFT - game fellows

Craft is a place / society / platform / environment for kids to learn some
programming. It builds with pixijs, fast webgl accelerated rendering library,
and adds a bunch of features to have smooth working environment. 
All projects are stored as git repositories and edits are done through 
integrated web editor.

There are three language options: finnish, spanish and english. 
No preliminary javascript experience is expected since there are multiple 
tutorials available which all help you to progress your skills.

Assets are provided from picture bank and maybe in future we can integrate 
paint app too.
